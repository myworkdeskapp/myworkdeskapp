## Roles & Career Levels

WorkDesk uses a two-axis access model: **Roles** define what a user can do; **Career Levels** indicate seniority.

### Organizational Roles

| Role | Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Entry Level** (Role 1) | Career L1–3 | Front-line staff. Can view and submit requests; all modifications require Supervisor approval. |
| **Supervisor** (Role 2) | Career L3–4 | Approves Entry Level requests. Limited edit access; self-modifications need Manager approval. |
| **Manager** (Role 3) | Career L5–6 | Full team management. Approves Supervisor-escalated requests. Self-modifications need Senior Manager approval. |
| **Senior Manager** (Role 4) | Career L6–7 | Cross-team oversight. Approves Manager requests. System-level changes require General Manager sign-off. |
| **General Manager** (Role 5) | Career L7–8 | Organization-wide authority. Final approver within the org. Can delegate Admin functions. |
| **Organization Admin** | — | Manages all org settings, user roles, and configurations. Assigned only by Super Admin. |
| **Super Admin** | — | Platform-level control (CEO / Platform Owner). Can create/modify/remove organizations and assign Org Admins. |

### Career Levels (1–8)

Career levels measure seniority and growth within a role track. They determine the scope of access but are always evaluated together with the employee's Role for final permission decisions.

| Level | Name | Typical Titles | Role Mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** | Entry | Associates, Assistants, Trainees | Role 1 |
| **L2** | Junior | Coordinators, Junior Specialists | Role 1–2 |
| **L3** | Associate | Specialists, Analysts | Role 2 |
| **L4** | Mid-Level | Senior Specialists, Team Leads | Role 2–3 |
| **L5** | Senior | Senior Analysts, Supervisors | Role 3 |
| **L6** | Lead | Managers, Department Heads | Role 3–4 |
| **L7** | Principal | Senior Managers, Directors | Role 4–5 |
| **L8** | Executive | General Managers, VPs, C-Suite | Role 5+ |

---

## Access & Permissions

Permissions are derived from each employee's Role. All modifications flow through an approval chain. Changes are recorded as **immutable audit footprints** visible only to Manager-level users and above. Employees below the visibility threshold receive a notification/disclaimer that a change occurred, but cannot see the change detail.

### Approval Chain

```
Entry Level → Supervisor → Manager → Senior Manager → General Manager → Admin → Super Admin
```

Each level may approve requests from the level directly below it. Managers and above require approval from their own next level for self-modifications.

### Attendance Records & AUX Status

- AUX (availability) status **must be set manually** after login — it defaults to **Offline**.
- Every AUX status change is timestamped and recorded in the employee's attendance log.
- Attendance records are **immutable**. Any correction requires:
  1. A written explanation from the employee
  2. A supporting attachment (screenshot, email, etc.)
  3. Approval from the next-level manager
- Correction requests from Managers require approval from Senior Managers; Senior Managers require General Manager approval.

## Cloudflare Queue Integration

WorkDesk uses **Cloudflare Queues** to offload background jobs from the request/response cycle.

### How it works

1. A Pages Function (producer) publishes a message to `WORKDESK_QUEUE` after accepting an API request.
2. The standalone `queue-consumer` Worker picks up messages in batches and processes them asynchronously.

### Queue Events

| Event | Published by | Consumer action |
|---|---|---|
| `notification.created` | `POST /api/notifications` | INSERT into D1 `notifications` table |
| `payroll.run` | `POST /api/payroll/run` | Compute pay, batch INSERT into `payroll_ledger` |
| `report.generate` | `POST /api/reports` | Aggregate D1 data, serialize, upload to R2 |

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Create the queue
npx wrangler queues create workdesk-queue

# 2. Deploy the Pages site (producer binding is already active in wrangler.toml)
wrangler pages deploy .

# 3. Configure and deploy the consumer Worker
#    Edit queue-consumer/wrangler.toml with your database_id and bucket_name
cd queue-consumer && wrangler deploy
```

### Status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Producer binding in wrangler.toml | ✅ Enabled |
| Producer code in notifications.js | ✅ Complete |
| Producer code in payroll.js | ✅ Complete |
| Producer code in reports.js | ✅ Complete |
| Consumer Worker (queue-consumer/) | ✅ Complete — deploy separately |

> All producers guard the queue call with `if (env.WORKDESK_QUEUE)`, so the API works in demo
> mode even when the queue is not yet configured.

---

## Deployment

WorkDesk is deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**.

### Prerequisites

- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) installed

### Deploy Steps

```bash
# Install Wrangler
npm install -g wrangler

# Authenticate with Cloudflare
wrangler login

# 1. Create D1 database
wrangler d1 create workdesk-db
# → Copy database_id into wrangler.toml [[d1_databases]]

# 2. Apply schema
wrangler d1 execute workdesk-db --file=./schema.sql

# 3. Create KV namespace (session store)
wrangler kv:namespace create "SESSIONS"
# → Copy id into wrangler.toml [[kv_namespaces]]

# 4. Create R2 bucket (file storage)
wrangler r2 bucket create workdesk-attachments

# 5. Create the queue
npx wrangler queues create workdesk-queue

# 6. Set secrets
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY    # optional — for AI Assistant

# 7. Deploy Pages site (includes queue producer binding)
wrangler pages deploy .

# 8. Deploy queue consumer Worker
cd queue-consumer && wrangler deploy
```

### Environment Variables

Uncomment and fill in `wrangler.toml` for non-sensitive config; use `wrangler secret put` for secrets:

```bash
# Non-sensitive (add to [vars] in wrangler.toml)
ENVIRONMENT = "production"
APP_NAME = "WorkDesk"
ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN = "yourcompany.com"

# Secrets (set via CLI — never commit)
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY   # optional: external LLM for AI Assistant
```

## Cloudflare Backend Notes

This section tracks every Cloudflare binding, secret, and configuration item required to run WorkDesk in production. Use it as a checklist when setting up a new deployment.

**Legend:** ✅ Already configured in source code &nbsp;|&nbsp; ❌ Must be set up by the deployer

---

### WorkDesk App — `myworkdeskapp` (Cloudflare Pages project)

Deploy from the repository **root**. Config: `wrangler.jsonc` / `_headers` / `_redirects`. The Super Admin Panel (`/app/login.html` role-based entry, `pages/sa-dashboard.html`, `/api/sa-auth`) is part of this same project.

#### Secrets (set via CLI — never commit)

| Secret | Status | Description | Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SA_USERNAME` | ❌ Required | Super-admin login username | `wrangler secret put SA_USERNAME --name myworkdeskapp` |
| `SA_SECURITY_KEY` | ❌ Required | Super-admin second-factor key | `wrangler secret put SA_SECURITY_KEY --name myworkdeskapp` |
| `SA_PASSWORD` | ❌ Required | Super-admin password | `wrangler secret put SA_PASSWORD --name myworkdeskapp` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ❌ Optional | External LLM for AI Assistant | `wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY --name myworkdeskapp` |

After setting all three SA secrets, verify with:
```bash
wrangler secret list --name myworkdeskapp
# Expected output lists SA_USERNAME, SA_SECURITY_KEY, SA_PASSWORD
```

#### Bindings (uncomment blocks in `wrangler.toml` after creating each resource)

| Binding | Status | Description | Setup command |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 Database (`DB`) | ❌ Required | All app data (employees, payroll, attendance, …) | `wrangler d1 create workdesk-db` → paste `database_id` into `[[d1_databases]]` in `wrangler.toml`, then run `wrangler d1 execute workdesk-db --file=./database/schema.sql` |
| KV Namespace (`SESSIONS`) | ❌ Required | User session token storage | `wrangler kv:namespace create "SESSIONS"` → paste `id` into `[[kv_namespaces]]` in `wrangler.toml` |
| R2 Bucket (`ATTACHMENTS`) | ❌ Required | File uploads (documents, message attachments) | `wrangler r2 bucket create workdesk-attachments` → uncomment `[[r2_buckets]]` in `wrangler.toml` |
| Queue Producer (`WORKDESK_QUEUE`) | ❌ Optional | Background jobs (notifications, payroll, reports) | `wrangler queues create workdesk-queue` → uncomment `[[queues.producers]]` in `wrangler.toml` |
| AI Binding | ❌ Optional | Cloudflare Workers AI (AI Assistant page) | Enable **Workers AI** in Cloudflare Dashboard → uncomment `[ai]` in `wrangler.toml` |

#### Already Configured in Source

| Item | Status | What it does | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| SA auth endpoint | ✅ Configured | `POST /api/sa-auth` (3-factor login, timing-safe), `GET /api/sa-auth` (token verify) | `functions/api/sa-auth.js` |
| SA org-admin endpoint | ✅ Configured | `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/sa-org-admins` — protected by SA token guard | `functions/api/sa-org-admins.js` |
| SA config check | ✅ Configured | `GET /api/sa-config-check` — verifies secrets are set | `functions/api/sa-config-check.js` |
| Security headers | ✅ Configured | `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, CSP, `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` for SA pages/routes | `_headers` |
| Login portal | ✅ Configured | Unified role-based login page for Super Admin/Admin/Employee | `app/login.html` |
| Dashboard | ✅ Configured | 8-hour session guard; token decoded and username cross-checked on load | `sa-dashboard.html` |

---

### Super Admin — Visibility &amp; Security Summary

The SA panel is protected at multiple layers to ensure it is **never publicly visible** and only accessible via a direct URL that is never linked publicly:

1. **No public links** — The main app does not link to the SA panel URL anywhere.
2. **`noindex` meta + `X-Robots-Tag`** — Search engines are instructed not to index any SA page or endpoint.
3. **Login wall** — Super Admin access starts at `/app/login.html` (role = Super Admin). `sa-dashboard.html` immediately redirects to `/app/login.html` if no valid session is found.
4. **3-factor credentials** — Login requires `SA_USERNAME`, `SA_SECURITY_KEY`, and `SA_PASSWORD` simultaneously, all stored as encrypted Cloudflare secrets (never in source code).
5. **Timing-safe comparison** — All credential checks use HMAC-based constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks.
6. **Token username verification** — `GET /api/sa-auth` and every request to `/api/sa-org-admins` decode the token and verify the embedded username against `env.SA_USERNAME`, preventing forged tokens.
7. **8-hour session expiry** — Client-side session expires automatically; KV-based server-side revocation is available (see optional `SA_SESSIONS` binding).

---

## API Endpoints

All API routes are Cloudflare Pages Functions in `functions/api/`. Every response is `application/json`.
All requests (except `POST /api/auth` and `POST /api/sa-auth`) require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## Design System

WorkDesk uses a **token-based design system** defined in `assets/css/styles.css` (`:root` CSS variables) and documented in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.

### Brand Colors

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--primary` | `#5A8F7B` | Buttons, active states, links |
| `--accent` | `#F4C86A` | Warnings, highlights |
| `--success` | `#3CB371` | Success states |
| `--danger` | `#E74C3C` | Error states, delete actions |
| `--text-main` | `#1A202C` | Body text |
| `--text-muted` | `#718096` | Secondary text |
| `--bg-main` | `#F5E9DA` | Page background |

### Typography

- **Font Family:** Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Weights:** 400, 500, 600, 700, 800

---

## Getting Started (Local Preview)

Since WorkDesk is a zero-build static site, you can preview it instantly with any local HTTP server.

### Option 1 — VS Code Live Server (Recommended)

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Install the **Live Server** extension.
3. Right-click `login.html` → **Open with Live Server**.

### Option 2 — Python

```bash
cd /path/to/WorkDesk
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080/login.html
```

### Option 3 — Node.js (npx serve)

```bash
npx serve .
# Open http://localhost:3000/login.html
```

### Default Login (Static / Demo)

Any valid email format + any password will navigate to the dashboard in static preview mode (the API call gracefully falls back when the Worker is not deployed).

---

## Guidelines & Conventions

### Naming Conventions

- **Employee IDs:** `EMP-001` format — three-digit zero-padded number prefixed with `EMP-`
- **Employee Photos:** Must be named exactly as the Employee ID (e.g., `EMP-001.jpg`, `EMP-001.svg`, `EMP-001.png`) and placed in `assets/images/employees/`
- **CSS Tokens:** Always use CSS custom properties from `:root` (e.g., `var(--primary)`). Never hardcode hex values.
- **JS Files:** One JavaScript file per page, located in `assets/js/`. Shared auth logic lives in `auth.js` at the project root.
- **API Files:** Each endpoint has its own file in `functions/api/`.

### Code Style

- **No frameworks, no bundler.** Keep the zero-build constraint.
- **Vanilla ES5/ES6** JavaScript only.
- **No inline styles** for design values — use CSS tokens.
- **HTML escaping** is required before rendering any user-provided data to prevent XSS (`escapeHtml()` helper is available in each JS file).
- **Accessibility:** All interactive elements must have `aria-label`, `role`, and keyboard support (Enter/Space).

### Security

- All HTTP security headers are defined in `_headers` (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.).
- Sessions are stored in `localStorage` under `workdesk_token` and `workdesk_display_name`.
- Logout clears `localStorage` and redirects to `login.html`.
- The Content Security Policy allows only `res.cloudinary.com` for external images and `fonts.googleapis.com` / `fonts.gstatic.com` for fonts.

### Adding a New Page

1. Copy the sidebar + topbar structure from any existing page (e.g., `employees.html`).
2. Set the correct `<li class="active">` item in the sidebar.
3. Add a new `<li>` entry in the sidebar of all other pages pointing to your new page.
4. If your page needs JavaScript, create `assets/js/yourpage.js` and include it at the bottom of the page.
5. If your page needs an API endpoint, create `functions/api/yourroute.js`.

## Security Admin Pipeline

WorkDesk ships a production-ready **admin-actions and security incident pipeline** built entirely on Cloudflare free-tier services (Workers, D1, R2, KV, Access, Pages).

### Architecture Overview

```
Cloudflare Access (SSO + MFA)
        │
        ▼
admin-ui/index.html  ──────►  workers/admin (workdesk-admin Worker)
  (Cloudflare Pages)              │
                                  ├─ POST /api/admin-actions
                                  ├─ GET  /api/admin-actions/:id
                                  ├─ POST /api/admin-actions/:id/approve
                                  ├─ POST /api/security/incidents
                                  ├─ POST /api/users/:id/disable
                                  ├─ POST /api/users/:id/enable
                                  └─ GET  /api/incidents
                                  │
                     ┌────────────┼────────────────┐
                     ▼            ▼                 ▼
                   D1 DB        R2 Audit          KV JTI
             (admin_actions,   (audit/YYYY/      (replay
              audit_log,        MM/DD/*.json,    protection)
              security_incidents manifests/)
              idempotency_store)

workers/cron/audit-verifier.js   — nightly 00:15 UTC
workers/cron/action-processor.js — every 5 min (retry + DLQ)
```

### Step 1 — Database Migrations

```bash
# Create the D1 database (once)
wrangler d1 create workdesk-db

# Apply base schema
wrangler d1 execute workdesk-db --file=database/schema.sql

# Apply admin pipeline migration
wrangler d1 execute workdesk-db --file=database/migrations/0001_admin_pipeline.sql

# Production remote execution
wrangler d1 execute workdesk-db --remote --file=database/migrations/0001_admin_pipeline.sql
```

### Step 2 — Create Cloudflare Resources

```bash
# R2 audit bucket
wrangler r2 bucket create workdesk-audit

# KV namespace for JTI replay protection
wrangler kv namespace create workdesk-jti
# → copy the id into workers/admin/wrangler.toml [[kv_namespaces]]
```

### Step 3 — Configure wrangler.toml

Edit `workers/admin/wrangler.toml` and uncomment + fill in:

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding       = "DB"
database_name = "workdesk-db"
database_id   = "YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID"   # from `wrangler d1 list`

[[r2_buckets]]
binding     = "AUDIT_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "workdesk-audit"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "JTI_STORE"
id      = "YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID"        # from `wrangler kv namespace list`
```

Do the same for `workers/cron/wrangler.audit-verifier.toml` and `workers/cron/wrangler.action-processor.toml`.

### Step 4 — Set Secrets

```bash
# Admin worker secrets
wrangler secret put ELEVATION_SECRET     --name workdesk-admin   # random 32+ char string
wrangler secret put SIGNING_KEY          --name workdesk-admin   # random 32+ char string
wrangler secret put SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL    --name workdesk-admin   # Slack Incoming Webhook URL
wrangler secret put EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL    --name workdesk-admin   # e.g. SendGrid /mail/send
wrangler secret put ALERT_EMAIL_TO       --name workdesk-admin   # comma-separated recipients
wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN --name workdesk-admin  # yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com
wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_AUD        --name workdesk-admin   # Access App audience tag

# Cron workers
wrangler secret put SIGNING_KEY          --name workdesk-audit-verifier
wrangler secret put SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL    --name workdesk-audit-verifier
wrangler secret put EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL    --name workdesk-audit-verifier
wrangler secret put ALERT_EMAIL_TO       --name workdesk-audit-verifier
wrangler secret put SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL    --name workdesk-action-processor
wrangler secret put EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL    --name workdesk-action-processor
wrangler secret put ALERT_EMAIL_TO       --name workdesk-action-processor
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit secrets to source control.** Always use `wrangler secret put`.

### Step 5 — Deploy Workers

```bash
# Admin API worker
cd workers/admin && wrangler deploy

# Audit verifier cron (runs nightly at 00:15 UTC)
cd workers/cron && wrangler deploy --config wrangler.audit-verifier.toml

# Action processor cron (runs every 5 minutes)
cd workers/cron && wrangler deploy --config wrangler.action-processor.toml
```

### Step 6 — Cloudflare Access Setup (click-by-click)

Protect the admin UI and worker API with Cloudflare Access + SSO + MFA:

1. **Log in** to [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) → **Zero Trust** → **Access** → **Applications**.
2. Click **Add an application** → **Self-hosted**.
3. **Application name**: `WorkDesk Admin`.  
   **Application domain**: `<your-pages-domain>/admin-ui/*` (e.g. `myworkdeskapp.pages.dev/admin-ui/*`).
4. Click **Next** → set **Session duration** to `8 hours`.
5. Under **Identity providers**, enable your IdP (Google Workspace, Okta, Azure AD, etc.) or use **One-time PIN**.
6. Click **Next** → **Add a policy**:
   - **Policy name**: `Admin Team`
   - **Action**: Allow
   - **Include rule**: Emails → add each admin's email address **or** use a Group from your IdP.
7. Under **Additional settings**, enable **Purpose justification** (optional) and **Multi-factor authentication (MFA required)**.
8. Click **Save**.
9. **Get the Audience tag**: on the application page, copy the **Audience** (aud) value → use it as `CF_ACCESS_AUD` secret.
10. **Team domain**: Settings → Custom Pages → note your `<team>.cloudflareaccess.com` hostname → use as `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` secret.

To also protect the Worker API directly, create a second Access Application for `<worker-subdomain>/api/*` and use the same policy.

### Step 7 — Deploy Admin UI

The admin UI (`admin-ui/index.html`) is a static Cloudflare Pages site.

```bash
# Via wrangler (manual)
wrangler pages deploy admin-ui --project-name=workdesk-admin-ui

# Or let GitHub Actions deploy it (it is included in the Pages deploy step in ci.yml)
```

### GitHub Actions CI

GitHub Actions (`ci.yml`) runs on push to `main`:
1. Lint + unit tests (`workers/admin`)
2. Deploy `workdesk-admin` worker
3. Deploy `workdesk-audit-verifier` cron
4. Deploy `workdesk-action-processor` cron
5. Deploy Cloudflare Pages

**Required GitHub Secrets** (Settings → Secrets → Actions):

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `CF_API_TOKEN` | Cloudflare API token with **Workers:Edit**, **Pages:Edit**, **D1:Edit**, **R2:Edit** permissions |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` | Your Cloudflare Account ID |

Generate a scoped token: Cloudflare Dashboard → Profile → API Tokens → **Create Token** → use the **Edit Cloudflare Workers** template, scope to your account.

### curl Test Vectors

```bash
# Set your worker URL and a test token
WORKER=https://workdesk-admin.<subdomain>.workers.dev
TOKEN=your-access-jwt-or-dev-email

# 1. Report a security incident
curl -s -X POST "$WORKER/api/security/incidents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "incident_type": "brute_force_login",
    "severity": "high",

    "user_id": "user-123",
    "detection_events": [
      {"type": "brute_force_login"},
      {"type": "suspicious_ip"}
    ]
  }'

# 2. Create an admin action manually
curl -s -X POST "$WORKER/api/admin-actions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  -d '{"action_type":"disable_user","target_user_id":"user-123","reason":"Security incident"}'

# 3. Get an admin action (replace <id>)
curl -s "$WORKER/api/admin-actions/<id>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 4. Approve an action (paste elevation_token from step 2 response)
curl -s -X POST "$WORKER/api/admin-actions/<id>/approve" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \

### Risk Scoring Thresholds (50-employee Pilot Defaults)

| Score | Decision | Action | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| 0–29  | `log`    | Audit only | Low-confidence events |
| 30–59 | `notify` | In-app notification | Unusual but not confirmed |
| 60–89 | `quarantine` | Quarantine user (requires approval) | Moderate-high confidence |
| ≥ 90  | `auto_disable` | Auto-disable (requires approval) | Very high confidence only |

Conservative by design: **quarantine first, auto-disable only for ≥ 90 score**.

Detection event weights:

| Event | Weight |
|-------|--------|
| `privilege_escalation` | 55 |
| `data_exfil_attempt` | 50 |
| `mfa_bypass_attempt` | 45 |
| `impossible_travel` | 40 |
| `brute_force_login` | 35 |
| `anomalous_download` | 30 |
| `suspicious_ip` | 25 |
| `repeated_auth_fail` | 20 |
| `policy_violation` | 20 |
| `after_hours_access` | 15 |
| unknown | 10 |

### Rollout Checklist

- [ ] `wrangler d1 create workdesk-db` and note the database ID
- [ ] Apply migrations: schema.sql + 0001_admin_pipeline.sql
- [ ] `wrangler r2 bucket create workdesk-audit`
- [ ] `wrangler kv namespace create workdesk-jti` and note the namespace ID
- [ ] Fill in `workers/admin/wrangler.toml` with IDs (D1, R2, KV)
- [ ] Fill in `workers/cron/wrangler.audit-verifier.toml` with D1 + R2 IDs
- [ ] Fill in `workers/cron/wrangler.action-processor.toml` with D1 + R2 IDs
- [ ] Set all 7 secrets via `wrangler secret put` (ELEVATION_SECRET, SIGNING_KEY, SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL, ALERT_EMAIL_TO, CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN, CF_ACCESS_AUD)
- [ ] Deploy admin worker: `cd workers/admin && wrangler deploy`
- [ ] Deploy cron workers: `cd workers/cron && wrangler deploy --config wrangler.audit-verifier.toml && wrangler deploy --config wrangler.action-processor.toml`
- [ ] Deploy admin UI: `wrangler pages deploy admin-ui --project-name=workdesk-admin-ui`
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare Access application for `<admin-ui-domain>/admin-ui/*`
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare Access application for `<worker-domain>/api/*`
- [ ] Add `CF_API_TOKEN` and `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` secrets to GitHub repository
- [ ] Trigger a test incident via curl and verify Slack alert received
- [ ] Verify nightly audit chain verifier fires and writes manifest to R2
- [ ] Review Grafana dashboard (`grafana/workdesk-security-dashboard.json`) imported correctly

### Grafana Dashboard

Import `grafana/workdesk-security-dashboard.json` into your Grafana instance:

1. Install the **JSON API** data source plugin (`marcusolsson-json-datasource`).
2. Add a new JSON API data source pointing to your admin worker URL with an Authorization header.
3. Grafana → Dashboards → Import → upload `grafana/workdesk-security-dashboard.json`.
4. Select the data source you created.

Panels:
- **Pending Admin Actions** — stat (thresholds: green < 5, yellow < 10, red ≥ 10)
- **Open Incidents** — stat
- **DLQ Depth** — stat (red for any value ≥ 1)
- **Audit Chain Health** — stat (green = OK, red = FAIL)
- **Incidents by Severity** — pie chart (24h)
- **Admin Actions Timeline** — timeseries grouped by status
- **Approval Latency P95** — gauge (minutes)
