## Overview

WorkDesk is a fully-featured HRIS platform designed for modern organizations. It provides:

- A **role-based** interface (HR Admin, Leader, Employee)
- **Real-time** metrics and activity feeds
- **Cloudflare Workers** API backend with D1 database, KV sessions, and R2 storage
- A **zero-build** frontend — pure HTML, CSS (custom tokens), and vanilla JavaScript with no bundler required

## Roles & Career Levels

WorkDesk uses a two-axis access model: **Roles** define what a user can do; **Career Levels** indicate seniority.

### Organizational Roles

| Role | Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Entry Level** (Role 1) | Career L1–3 | Front-line staff. Can view and submit requests; all modifications require Supervisor approval. |
| **Supervisor** (Role 2) | Career L3–4 | Approves Entry Level requests. Limited edit access; self-modifications need Manager approval. |
| **Manager** (Role 3) | Career L5–6 | Full team management. Approves Supervisor-escalated requests. Self-modifications need Senior Manager approval. |
| **Senior Manager** (Role 4) | Career L6–7 | Cross-team oversight. Approves Manager requests. System-level changes require General Manager sign-off. |
| **General Manager** (Role 5) | Career L7–8 | Organization-wide authority. Final approver within the org. Can delegate Admin functions. |
| **Organization Admin** | — | Manages all org settings, user roles, and configurations. Assigned only by Super Admin. |
| **Super Admin** | — | Platform-level control (CEO / Platform Owner). Can create/modify/remove organizations and assign Org Admins. |

### Career Levels (1–8)

Career levels measure seniority and growth within a role track. They determine the scope of access but are always evaluated together with the employee's Role for final permission decisions.

| Level | Name | Typical Titles | Role Mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** | Entry | Associates, Assistants, Trainees | Role 1 |
| **L2** | Junior | Coordinators, Junior Specialists | Role 1–2 |
| **L3** | Associate | Specialists, Analysts | Role 2 |
| **L4** | Mid-Level | Senior Specialists, Team Leads | Role 2–3 |
| **L5** | Senior | Senior Analysts, Supervisors | Role 3 |
| **L6** | Lead | Managers, Department Heads | Role 3–4 |
| **L7** | Principal | Senior Managers, Directors | Role 4–5 |
| **L8** | Executive | General Managers, VPs, C-Suite | Role 5+ |

---

## Access & Permissions

Permissions are derived from each employee's Role. All modifications flow through an approval chain. Changes are recorded as **immutable audit footprints** visible only to Manager-level users and above. Employees below the visibility threshold receive a notification/disclaimer that a change occurred, but cannot see the change detail.

### Approval Chain

```
Entry Level → Supervisor → Manager → Senior Manager → General Manager → Admin → Super Admin
```

Each level may approve requests from the level directly below it. Managers and above require approval from their own next level for self-modifications.

### Attendance Records & AUX Status

- AUX (availability) status **must be set manually** after login — it defaults to **Offline**.
- Every AUX status change is timestamped and recorded in the employee's attendance log.
- Attendance records are **immutable**. Any correction requires:
  1. A written explanation from the employee
  2. A supporting attachment (screenshot, email, etc.)
  3. Approval from the next-level manager
- Correction requests from Managers require approval from Senior Managers; Senior Managers require General Manager approval.

### Permission Summary

| Module / Action | Entry (L1–3) | Supervisor (L4) | Manager (L5–6) | Sr. Manager (L7) | GM / Admin (L8) |

## Deployment

WorkDesk is deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**.

### Prerequisites

- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) installed

### Deploy Steps

APP_NAME = "WorkDesk"
ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN = "yourcompany.com"
```

---

## API Endpoints

All API routes are handled by Cloudflare Workers in the `functions/api/` directory.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |

| POST | `/api/leave` | Submit or update a leave request |
| GET | `/api/payroll` | Get payroll records |

---

## Design System

WorkDesk uses a **token-based design system** defined in `assets/css/styles.css` (`:root` CSS variables) and documented in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.

### Brand Colors

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--primary` | `#3A8F7B` | Buttons, active states, links |
| `--accent` | `#F4C86A` | Warnings, highlights |
| `--success` | `#3CB371` | Success states |
| `--danger` | `#E74C3C` | Error states, delete actions |
| `--text-main` | `#1A202C` | Body text |
| `--text-muted` | `#718096` | Secondary text |
| `--bg-main` | `#F7F8FA` | Page background |

### Typography

- **Font Family:** Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Weights:** 400, 500, 600, 700, 800

---

## Getting Started (Local Preview)

Since WorkDesk is a zero-build static site, you can preview it instantly with any local HTTP server.

### Option 1 — VS Code Live Server (Recommended)

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Install the **Live Server** extension.
3. Right-click `login.html` → **Open with Live Server**.

### Option 2 — Python

```bash
cd /path/to/WorkDesk
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080/login.html
```

### Option 3 — Node.js (npx serve)

```bash
npx serve .
# Open http://localhost:3000/login.html
```

### Default Login (Static / Demo)

Any valid email format + any password will navigate to the dashboard in static preview mode (the API call gracefully falls back when the Worker is not deployed).

---

## Guidelines & Conventions

### Naming Conventions

- **Employee IDs:** `EMP-001` format — three-digit zero-padded number prefixed with `EMP-`
- **Employee Photos:** Must be named exactly as the Employee ID (e.g., `EMP-001.jpg`, `EMP-001.svg`, `EMP-001.png`) and placed in `assets/images/employees/`
- **CSS Tokens:** Always use CSS custom properties from `:root` (e.g., `var(--primary)`). Never hardcode hex values.
- **JS Files:** One JavaScript file per page, located in `assets/js/`. Shared auth logic lives in `auth.js` at the project root.
- **API Files:** Each endpoint has its own file in `functions/api/`.

### Code Style

- **No frameworks, no bundler.** Keep the zero-build constraint.
- **Vanilla ES5/ES6** JavaScript only.
- **No inline styles** for design values — use CSS tokens.
- **HTML escaping** is required before rendering any user-provided data to prevent XSS (`escapeHtml()` helper is available in each JS file).
- **Accessibility:** All interactive elements must have `aria-label`, `role`, and keyboard support (Enter/Space).

### Security

- All HTTP security headers are defined in `_headers` (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.).
- Sessions are stored in `localStorage` under `workdesk_token` and `workdesk_display_name`.
- Logout clears `localStorage` and redirects to `login.html`.
- The Content Security Policy allows only `res.cloudinary.com` for external images and `fonts.googleapis.com` / `fonts.gstatic.com` for fonts.

### Adding a New Page

1. Copy the sidebar + topbar structure from any existing page (e.g., `employees.html`).
2. Set the correct `<li class="active">` item in the sidebar.
3. Add a new `<li>` entry in the sidebar of all other pages pointing to your new page.
4. If your page needs JavaScript, create `assets/js/yourpage.js` and include it at the bottom of the page.
5. If your page needs an API endpoint, create `functions/api/yourroute.js`.
